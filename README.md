### Notice

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (1.11.0+cu113). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)，for beam search decode.

- This project runs in pycharm, so you need to install pycharm

- The SLR is the main function.

### Data Preparation

1. Download the CE-CSL Dataset[[download link]]https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OHJLRfLFPWqkxvLBr4KAQg 
   extraction code：0000
   
2. After finishing dataset download, extract it.

3. ﻿Download the latest weight, test WER is 32.46%.[[download link]]https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KPbDL2nAvBsSsTDwc9og0A 
   extraction code：0000

---
### Data Process
1. Run python CE-CSLDataPreProcess.py to convert video data to image data.

2. SRL.py is the main function

3. Remember to change the path to the dataset before running it.
